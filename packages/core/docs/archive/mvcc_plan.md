# MVCC Implementation Requirements for Sombra

## Executive Summary

Sombra currently implements a **single-writer, multi-reader** concurrency model using `RwLock`. To achieve MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), the database needs substantial architectural changes across 8 major subsystems. This analysis identifies all required modifications for implementing snapshot isolation with concurrent readers and writers.

### Implementation Status (As of October 29, 2025)

**Completed Phases: 5 of 6** 🎯
- ✅ **Phase 1: Foundation** - Timestamp oracle, header extensions, WAL support
- ✅ **Phase 2: Version Management** - Version chains, visibility checks, metadata
- ✅ **Phase 3: Transaction Overhaul** - Concurrent transaction infrastructure complete
- ✅ **Phase 4: Index Updates** - Multi-version index support COMPLETE
- ✅ **Phase 5: Garbage Collection** - Full GC implementation with background support

**Pending:**
- 📋 **Phase 6: Testing and Optimization** - Final production readiness

**Critical Achievement**: Fixed the `commit_ts` bug (Issue #3) - GC now fully functional with all 9 tests passing. The bug had two parts:
1. Dirty page tracking missing in `RecordStore` 
2. Metadata offset calculation error (reading at offset 1 instead of 8)

## Current Architecture Overview

### Transaction Model

- **Current**: Single active write transaction at a time (`active_transaction: Option<TxId>`)
- **Isolation**: Serializable (single-writer prevents conflicts)
- **Readers**: Multi-reader support via `RwLock` but readers block during write transactions
- **State Tracking**: `TxState` enum (Active, Committed, RolledBack)
- **Dirty Page Tracking**: Vector of modified `PageId`s per transaction

### Storage Layer

- **Page-based storage**: 8KB pages with checksums
- **Records**: In-place updates with `RecordHeader` (kind, payload_length)
- **Record Types**: Node (0x01), Edge (0x02), Free (0x00)
- **No versioning**: Records updated in-place, no version chain
- **WAL**: Transaction-aware with commit markers

### Data Structures

- **Nodes**: `id`, `labels`, `properties`, edge linked lists
- **Edges**: `id`, `source_node_id`, `target_node_id`, `type_name`, `properties`, linked list pointers
- **No version metadata**: No transaction ID, timestamps, or version pointers

## Required Changes for MVCC

### 1. Version Storage Layer

**Files to modify:**

- `packages/core/src/storage/record.rs`
- `packages/core/src/storage/ser.rs`
- `packages/core/src/model.rs`

**Changes needed:**

#### Add Version Metadata to Records

```rust
// Add to RecordKind enum
pub enum RecordKind {
    Free = 0x00,
    Node = 0x01,
    Edge = 0x02,
    NodeVersion = 0x03,    // NEW: Versioned node record
    EdgeVersion = 0x04,    // NEW: Versioned edge record
}

// New version chain structure
pub struct VersionHeader {
    pub tx_id: TxId,           // Transaction that created this version
    pub commit_ts: u64,         // Commit timestamp
    pub prev_version: Option<RecordPointer>,  // Pointer to previous version
    pub is_deleted: bool,       // Tombstone marker
}
```

#### Extend Node/Edge Structures

```rust
// Add to Node struct in model.rs
pub struct Node {
    pub id: NodeId,
    pub labels: Vec<String>,
    pub properties: BTreeMap<String, PropertyValue>,
    pub first_outgoing_edge_id: EdgeId,
    pub first_incoming_edge_id: EdgeId,
    
    // NEW MVCC fields
    pub created_tx_id: TxId,
    pub modified_tx_id: TxId,
    pub version_chain: Option<RecordPointer>,
}

// Add to Edge struct
pub struct Edge {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // NEW MVCC fields
    pub created_tx_id: TxId,
    pub modified_tx_id: TxId,
    pub version_chain: Option<RecordPointer>,

**Changes needed:**

#### Transaction Context

```rust
pub struct Transaction<'db> {
    db: &'db mut GraphDB,
    id: TxId,
    epoch: u64,
    state: TxState,
    pub dirty_pages: Vec<PageId>,
    start_time: Instant,
    
    // NEW MVCC fields
    pub snapshot_ts: u64,              // Read timestamp for snapshot isolation
    pub commit_ts: Option<u64>,         // Commit timestamp (assigned at commit)
    pub read_set: HashSet<RecordPointer>,  // Track reads for validation
    pub write_set: HashMap<RecordPointer, Version>,  // Staged writes
}

// New snapshot structure
pub struct Snapshot {
    pub ts: u64,
    pub active_tx_ids: BTreeSet<TxId>,  // Active transactions at snapshot time
}
```

#### Concurrent Transaction Support

```rust
pub struct TimestampOracle {
    current: AtomicU64,
    active_snapshots: Mutex<BTreeMap<u64, SnapshotInfo>>,
}

impl TimestampOracle {
    pub fn allocate_read_timestamp(&self) -> u64;
    pub fn allocate_commit_timestamp(&self) -> u64;
    pub fn get_snapshot(&self, ts: u64) -> Snapshot;

- All read operations in GraphDB

**Changes needed:**

#### Visibility Logic

```rust
impl Transaction<'_> {
    fn is_visible(&self, version: &VersionHeader) -> bool {
        // Version created by this transaction
        if version.tx_id == self.id {
            return !version.is_deleted;
        }
        
        // Version created after our snapshot
        if version.commit_ts > self.snapshot_ts {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Version from uncommitted transaction in our snapshot
        if self.snapshot.active_tx_ids.contains(&version.tx_id) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Version is visible
        !version.is_deleted
    }
    
    fn get_visible_version(&self, ptr: RecordPointer) -> Result<Option<RecordPointer>> {
        let mut current = Some(ptr);
        while let Some(ptr) = current {
            let version_header = self.db.load_version_header(ptr)?;
            if self.is_visible(&version_header) {
                return Ok(Some(ptr));
            }
            current = version_header.prev_version;
        }
        Ok(None)
    }
}
```

**Modify every read operation:**

- `get_node()` → Walk version chain until visible version found
- `get_edge()` → Same versioning logic
- `get_neighbors()` → Filter by visibility
- `get_nodes_by_label()` → Filter by visibility
- Index lookups → Return version pointers, then filter by visibility

    root: Arc<RwLock<BTreeMap<NodeId, Vec<RecordPointer>>>>,  // Changed
}

impl BTreeIndex {
    // Keep latest version at front of vector
    pub fn insert_version(&mut self, key: NodeId, version: RecordPointer);
    
    // Return all versions for visibility filtering
    pub fn get_versions(&self, key: &NodeId) -> Option<Vec<RecordPointer>>;
}
```

#### Property Indexes

```rust
// Current: property value → node IDs
HashMap<(String, String), BTreeMap<IndexableValue, BTreeSet<NodeId>>>

// New header size: 40 bytes
```

#### Recovery Logic

    pub fn replay_mvcc<F>(&mut self, apply: F) -> Result<u32>
    where F: FnMut(PageId, &[u8], u64, u64) -> Result<()>  // Added timestamps
    {
        // Group by transaction

**1. Transaction Throughput** (1000 sequential node creations):
- Single-writer: 34.33ms total, 29,131 txn/sec
- MVCC: 34.25ms total, 29,197 txn/sec
- **MVCC overhead: -0.2%** (essentially identical performance)

**2. Read Latency with Version Chains**:
- Chain depth 0:  Single-writer 0.44μs, MVCC 4.22μs (859% overhead)
- Chain depth 5:  Single-writer 0.45μs, MVCC 4.18μs (820% overhead)
- Chain depth 10: Single-writer 0.50μs, MVCC 4.31μs (757% overhead)
- Chain depth 25: Single-writer 0.50μs, MVCC 4.34μs (763% overhead)
- Chain depth 50: Single-writer 0.49μs, MVCC 4.34μs (786% overhead)
- **Finding**: Read overhead remains constant ~4μs regardless of chain depth (efficient traversal)

**3. Write Amplification** (100 nodes × 50 updates each):
- Single-writer: 14.42ms, 32 KB on disk
- MVCC: 19.08ms, 40 KB on disk
- **Time overhead: +32.3%**
- **Space amplification: +25% (1.2x disk usage)**

**4. Memory Usage** (version chain growth):
- Version storage overhead is minimal when not checkpointed
- Database file size remains constant at 40 KB across 0-100 updates
- In-memory version chains managed efficiently

**5. Update Hot Spots** (same 10 nodes, 100 updates each):
- Single-writer: 5.47ms
- MVCC: 6.17ms
- **MVCC overhead: +12.9%**

**6. Timestamp Allocation Overhead** (empty transactions):
- Single-writer: 18.75μs per transaction
- MVCC: 389.59μs per transaction
- **MVCC adds: +370.84μs per transaction** (timestamp oracle overhead)

**7. Traversal Performance** (1000 neighbor queries):
- Single-writer: 20.52μs per query
- MVCC (clean): 392.27μs per query (+1812%)
- MVCC (10 versions): 391.44μs per query (+1808%)
- **Finding**: Version chain depth does not significantly impact traversal

**Concurrent Read Throughput** (from `concurrent_throughput.rs`):
- 1 thread: 1,556,420 ops/sec (0.64μs latency)
- 2 threads: 994,448 ops/sec (1.01μs latency)
- 5 threads: 522,876 ops/sec (1.91μs latency)
- 10 threads: 444,337 ops/sec (2.25μs latency)
- 20 threads: 488,271 ops/sec (2.05μs latency)
- 50 threads: 492,914 ops/sec (2.03μs latency)
- **Finding**: Read throughput scales well up to ~20 threads, plateaus at ~500K ops/sec

**Concurrent Write Throughput**:
- 1 thread: 14,721 ops/sec (67.93μs latency)
- 2 threads: 13,329 ops/sec (75.03μs latency)
- **Finding**: Write throughput shows slight degradation with concurrency

**Criterion Statistical Benchmarks**:
- Transaction overhead (single-writer): 22.13μs ± 0.30μs
- Transaction overhead (MVCC): 388.62μs ± 1.54μs
- **MVCC timestamp allocation adds ~367μs per transaction**

**Key Performance Insights**:
1. ✅ MVCC transaction throughput is essentially identical to single-writer for sequential workloads
2. ✅ Version chain traversal is efficient - overhead constant regardless of chain depth
3. ⚠️ Read latency overhead of ~4μs per operation (timestamp checking + version traversal)
4. ⚠️ Timestamp oracle adds ~370μs per transaction (could be optimized)
5. ⚠️ Write amplification of 32% for high-update workloads
6. ✅ Concurrent read throughput scales to 500K ops/sec with 20+ threads
7. ❌ Concurrent write throughput degrades slightly (likely due to contention)

**Identified Bottlenecks**:
- Timestamp allocation overhead is surprisingly high (~370μs) - timestamp oracle locking may be a bottleneck
- Traversal overhead (+1800%) suggests version chain reads may need optimization
- Write concurrency doesn't scale well (likely global write lock)

**Known Issues Found During Benchmarking**:
- ❌ Checkpoint fails with "not a record page (magic: BIDX)" error when persisting B-tree indexes
- ❌ Some concurrent write tests fail with "record index out of bounds" under load
- These issues are tracked for future investigation

**Total estimated effort**: 32-44 weeks (8-11 months)

## Performance Bottleneck Analysis

Based on benchmark results, the following bottlenecks have been identified and prioritized for optimization:

### Critical Bottlenecks (High Impact)

**1. Timestamp Oracle Overhead (+370μs per transaction)**

*Current State:*
- Each transaction allocates a timestamp via `TimestampOracle`
- Adds 370μs overhead compared to single-writer mode (18.75μs → 388.62μs)
- This is a 20x slowdown for empty transactions

*Root Cause Analysis:*
- Likely global lock contention in timestamp allocation
- Atomic counter + lock for snapshot tracking
- Possible fine-grained locking issues

*Optimization Opportunities:*
- [ ] Use lock-free atomic operations for timestamp allocation
- [ ] Batch timestamp allocation for multiple transactions
- [ ] Use thread-local timestamp caches
- [ ] Reduce snapshot bookkeeping overhead
- **Estimated improvement: 10-50x reduction (370μs → 10-40μs)**

**2. Traversal Performance Overhead (+1800%)**

*Current State:*
- Neighbor traversal: 20.52μs (single-writer) → 392.27μs (MVCC)
- 19x slowdown for graph traversal operations
- Critical for graph algorithms and analytics queries

*Root Cause Analysis:*
- Each edge/node read requires version visibility check
- Multiple timestamp comparisons per traversal hop
- Possibly inefficient version chain reads

*Optimization Opportunities:*
- [ ] Cache version visibility results within a transaction
- [ ] Batch version visibility checks for traversal operations
- [ ] Pre-filter visible versions at page load time
- [ ] Optimize hot path for latest version reads (most common case)
- **Estimated improvement: 5-10x reduction (392μs → 40-80μs)**

**3. Read Latency Overhead (+800% constant overhead)**

*Current State:*
- Read latency: 0.5μs (single-writer) → 4.2μs (MVCC)
- Overhead is constant regardless of version chain depth (good!)
- Affects all read operations

*Root Cause Analysis:*
- Timestamp comparison overhead
- Version metadata access
- Visibility predicate evaluation

*Optimization Opportunities:*
- [ ] Inline hot-path visibility checks
- [ ] Use CPU branch prediction hints
- [ ] Optimize version metadata layout for cache locality
- [ ] Fast-path for "read latest version" (no active writers)
- **Estimated improvement: 2-4x reduction (4.2μs → 1-2μs)**

### Medium Bottlenecks (Moderate Impact)

**4. Write Amplification (+32% time, +25% space)**

*Current State:*
- Write time: 14.42ms → 19.08ms (+32%)
- Disk space: 32 KB → 40 KB (+25%)
- Acceptable for MVCC but could be optimized

*Root Cause:*
- Creating new version for each update (by design)
- Version metadata storage overhead
- Additional index updates for versioned records

*Optimization Opportunities:*
- [ ] Compress version metadata
- [ ] Implement delta encoding for small updates
- [ ] Optimize version chain page layout
- **Estimated improvement: 10-20% reduction**

**5. Concurrent Write Scalability**

*Current State:*
- Write throughput degrades with concurrency (14,721 → 13,329 ops/sec with 2 threads)
- Suggests contention on shared resources

*Root Cause Analysis:*
- Possible global write lock
- Page-level lock contention
- Timestamp oracle contention (see #1)

*Optimization Opportunities:*
- [ ] Profile lock contention with perf tools
- [ ] Implement fine-grained page-level locks
- [ ] Reduce critical section sizes
- [ ] Use optimistic locking for low-contention cases
- **Estimated improvement: Maintain 14K+ ops/sec with multiple writers**

### Low Priority Bottlenecks

**6. Concurrent Read Scalability Plateau**

*Current State:*
- Read throughput plateaus at ~500K ops/sec with 20+ threads
- Still 500x better than writes, so not critical

*Analysis:*
- Likely page cache contention
- Memory bandwidth saturation
- Acceptable for most workloads

*Future Optimization:*
- [ ] Implement per-thread page caches
- [ ] Use NUMA-aware memory allocation
- **Estimated improvement: 20-50% increase to 600-750K ops/sec**

### Known Issues (Bug Fixes Required)

**Issue #1: Checkpoint BIDX Page Error**
```
Error: InvalidArgument("not a record page (magic: \"BIDX\")")
```
- Occurs during `db.checkpoint()` with MVCC enabled
- Suggests incorrect page type handling in B-tree index persistence
- **Priority: HIGH** - Blocks production use
- [ ] Investigate `persist_btree_index()` implementation
- [ ] Add page type validation before reads
- [ ] Fix page type detection for versioned indexes

**Issue #2: Concurrent Write "Record Index Out of Bounds"**
```
Error: InvalidArgument("record index out of bounds")
```
- Occurs in concurrent write benchmarks with 5+ threads
- Suggests race condition in record allocation or indexing
- **Priority: MEDIUM** - Affects concurrent write correctness
- [ ] Add bounds checking and error logging
- [ ] Investigate record allocation concurrency
- [ ] Add integration test to reproduce
