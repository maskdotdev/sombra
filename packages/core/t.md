Issue #1: Version chain traversal not implemented

‚Ä¢ Status: ‚úÖ Known limitation, documented
‚Ä¢ Code only reads head version, doesn't follow prev_version chain
‚Ä¢ Comment at version_chain.rs:133 explicitly states this is deferred
‚Ä¢ Impact: Medium priority, breaks historical reads but most apps want latest data

Issue #2: commit_ts==0 visibility logic

‚Ä¢ Status: ‚úÖ NOT a bug (initially appeared suspicious)
‚Ä¢ The snapshot_ts == 0 condition is for legacy record backward compatibility
‚Ä¢ Logic correctly handles both MVCC and non-MVCC modes
‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Add clarifying comments

Issue #3: Edges created with tx_id=0 üî¥ - FIXED

‚Ä¢ Status: üêõ CRITICAL BUG
‚Ä¢ Location: src/db/core/edges.rs:52-60
‚Ä¢ Edge creation passes tx_id=0 to store_new_version(), unlike nodes which pass actual tx_id
‚Ä¢ Breaks read-your-own-writes for edges within transactions
‚Ä¢ Fix: 5 lines - pass tx_id and commit_ts to add_edge_internal() like nodes do

Issue #4: Traversal snapshot isolation - FIXED

‚Ä¢ Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial issue
‚Ä¢ Traversals use load_edge() not load_edge_with_snapshot()
‚Ä¢ Edge list structure is snapshot-isolated (stored in node versions)
‚Ä¢ But edge properties might show newer version data
‚Ä¢ Fix: 10 lines - use snapshot-aware edge loading in traversals

Issue #5: Stale index entries on node update

‚Ä¢ Status: ‚úÖ Known limitation with TODO comment
‚Ä¢ Location: src/db/core/nodes.rs:140-148
‚Ä¢ Old labels/properties not removed from indexes on update
‚Ä¢ Explicitly marked as TODO in code
‚Ä¢ Impact: Medium-high priority, affects query correctness

Issue #6: No file locking üî¥

‚Ä¢ Status: ‚ùå CRITICAL MISSING FEATURE - FIXED
‚Ä¢ No inter-process file locking implemented
‚Ä¢ Multiple processes can corrupt database
‚Ä¢ Fix: 30 lines using fs2 crate for exclusive lock

Issue #7: API requires &mut -DONE

‚Ä¢ Status: ‚úÖ Intentional design choice
‚Ä¢ All methods require &mut GraphDB, preventing concurrent access
‚Ä¢ MVCC infrastructure exists but API doesn't expose concurrency
‚Ä¢ Not a bug - valid single-threaded design
‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Document this limitation
