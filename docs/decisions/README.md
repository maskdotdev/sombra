Decision Log
============

Lightweight ADRs live here. Keep each decision to one page covering context, options, decision, rollback, and owner.

Template
- Title and date.
- Context/problem: why now?
- Options considered (short bullets).
- Decision and scope.
- Rollback/mitigations.
- Owner and reviewers.
- Links: PRs, issues, related docs.

Filing rules
- Required when changing isolation semantics, on-disk format, replication/HA behavior, security defaults, or operator-facing contracts.
- Link each ADR from `docs/production-readiness.md` when it affects readiness criteria or test matrices.
