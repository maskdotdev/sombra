# Contributing to Sombra

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Stage 0 focuses on laying down the
repository structure and tooling. Please follow the guidelines below when
working on changes:

1. Install the pinned toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`) and run `cargo fmt`,
   `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` before submitting PRs.
2. Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to apply linting and formatting checks for
   Rust and Python code.
3. Coordinate larger changes through issues or the roadmap documents in
   `docs/build/`.
4. Keep documentation up to date, especially the stage documents when advancing
   milestones.

Further contribution rules (code of conduct, review process, etc.) will be
fleshed out in later stages as functionality lands.
