# Stage 1 & 2 — Bytes, Checksum, I/O, and Pager

Detailed specifications for Stage 1 (encoding and checksums) and Stage 2 (I/O
and pager) live in `docs/build/stage_1.md` and `docs/build/stage_2.md`
respectively. This high-level document serves as a table of contents for those
plans and should be updated with key milestones as they are completed.

- Stage 1 highlights: order-preserving encodings, varints, checksums, and tests.
- Stage 2 highlights: cross-platform file I/O, pager/cache implementation, and
  on-disk free-list management.

Consult the build documents for precise APIs, invariants, and test plans.
