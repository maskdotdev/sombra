# Production Readiness Assessment: Sombra Graph Database

## Architecture Overview
**Core**: Rust-based embedded graph database (~10,000+ LOC)
**Storage**: Custom page-based storage with 8KB pages, WAL for durability, page-level checksums
**Indexing**: BTreeIndex (currently HashMap-backed) for node lookup
**Transactions**: ACID with rollback support via shadow pages
**Observability**: Structured logging with tracing, comprehensive metrics, health checks
**Tooling**: CLI tools for inspection, repair, and verification

---

## ✅ Strengths

### 1. Solid Foundation
- Clean architecture: pager → storage → db layers
- WAL with crash recovery and checksums (CRC32)
- ACID transactions with proper isolation
- All 44 unit tests + 10 integration tests passing

### 2. Durability & Recovery
- ✅ Write-Ahead Logging with frame-level checksums
- ✅ Checkpoint mechanism to merge WAL → main file
- ✅ Shadow page system for rollback
- ✅ Transaction ID persistence across restarts
- ✅ Page-level checksums for corruption detection (Config::checksum_enabled)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown with GraphDB::close()
- ✅ Startup consistency checks (header validation, WAL integrity verification)
- ✅ Corruption recovery options and repair tooling (sombra-repair CLI)
- ✅ Database integrity verification (GraphDB::verify_integrity())

### 3. Performance Features
- ✅ Configurable sync modes (Full/Normal/GroupCommit/Off)
- ✅ LRU caching (nodes: 10k, edges: 100k, pages: configurable)
- ✅ Memory-mapped I/O support
- ✅ Group commit for batched syncs
- ✅ Production config preset available (Config::production())
- ✅ Resource limits (max DB size, max WAL size, transaction timeouts)
- ✅ Auto-checkpoint when WAL size exceeds threshold
- ✅ Performance metrics with P50/P95/P99 latency tracking

### 4. Graph Model
- Native property graph: nodes with labels/properties, typed edges
- Adjacency lists stored in-node for traversal
- Property indexing (bool/int/string)
- Edge chains for multi-edge support

---

## ⚠️ Production Concerns

### 1. Core Storage & Consistency
- **Property index not persisted**: Indexes lost on restart (src/db/core/index.rs:99, src/db/core/property_index.rs:8)
- **Missing float/bytes indexing**: Only bool/int/string supported
- **HashMap masquerading as BTree**: No ordered scans or range queries (src/index/btree.rs:7)
- **No update-in-place**: Properties/labels require delete+reinsert (src/db/core/nodes.rs:9, src/db/core/edges.rs:8)
- **No schema enforcement**: No unique constraints, required properties, or relationship type validation
- **No compaction tooling**: File grows unbounded, no vacuum/defragmentation (src/db/core/records.rs:174)

### 2. Transactions & Concurrency
- **No multi-writer support**: Single Mutex serializes all writes (src/db/transaction.rs:22, src/bindings.rs:12)
- **No isolation level control**: Cannot configure read committed vs serializable
- **No timeout/deadlock detection**: Transactions can hang indefinitely
- **Unsafe binding lifecycle**: No automatic rollback on drop, nested transaction errors not bubbled

### 3. Critical Missing Features
- **No query language**: Raw API only (no Cypher/Gremlin)
- **Limited backup story**: Manual file copy while DB closed
- **No replication**: Single-node only

### 4. Security & Access Control
- **No authentication/authorization**: Open access to all data
- **No encryption at rest**: Database files stored in plaintext
- **No TLS support**: Bindings communicate unencrypted
- **Limited input validation**: Type coercion, size limits, and label format checks incomplete in bindings

### 5. Scalability Questions
- In-memory indexes (node_index, edge_index, label_index) grow unbounded
- No index eviction strategy
- Page cache eviction during transactions can fail (line 134 in pager/mod.rs)
- No statistics/query planning

### 6. Observability
- ✅ **Comprehensive metrics**: WAL flush counts, transaction counts, latency histograms, cache stats
- ✅ **Structured logging**: Transaction lifecycle, checkpoints, and errors logged with tracing crate
- ✅ **Tracing instrumentation**: Pager IO, index operations, and group commit instrumented
- ✅ **Metrics export**: Prometheus, JSON, and StatsD formats available
- ✅ **Health checks**: Programmatic health monitoring with GraphDB::health_check()

### 7. Operational Tooling
- ✅ **Admin CLI**: sombra-inspect for health checks, verification, statistics
- ✅ **Repair tooling**: sombra-repair for checkpoint and vacuum operations
- ✅ **Verification tooling**: sombra-verify for database integrity checks
- ✅ **Package distribution**: Published to crates.io, PyPI, npm
- ✅ **Deployment guides**: Complete production guide with monitoring, backup, K8s manifests
- ✅ **Docker support**: Production-ready Dockerfile
- ✅ **Migration guides**: Version upgrade documentation available

### 8. Schema Management
- **No constraint enforcement**: Cannot define unique labels or required properties
- **No relationship type validation**: Edges lack type constraints
- **No schema evolution**: No migration path for schema changes between versions
- **No validation hooks**: Cannot add custom validation rules

### 9. API Maturity
- Transaction must be explicitly committed/rolled back (panic if dropped active)
- Property indexes cannot be created within transactions
- No bulk import utilities
- Limited traversal API (only direct neighbors)

### 10. Performance & Scalability
- ✅ **Background compaction**: Optional background compaction for space reclamation
- ✅ **Configuration presets**: production(), balanced(), benchmark() presets available
- ✅ **Comprehensive benchmarks**: Full benchmark suite with performance validation
- ⚠️ **Index operations**: Index creation still blocks all operations (future enhancement)
- ⚠️ **Statistics collection**: Query planning limited without cardinality estimates (future enhancement)

### 11. Testing Coverage
- ✅ Excellent unit test coverage for core features (58+ tests)
- ✅ Power-loss recovery tests, WAL replay edge cases, corrupted page handling
- ✅ Long-running soak tests (stress_long_running.rs with 1M+ operations)
- ✅ Binding compatibility tests (Python and Node.js integration tests)
- ✅ Comprehensive fuzz testing for corruption scenarios (10,000+ iterations)
- ✅ Property-based tests with proptest (10,000 random scenarios)
- ✅ Failure injection tests for disk errors, fsync failures, OOM
- ✅ Benchmark suite with performance validation
