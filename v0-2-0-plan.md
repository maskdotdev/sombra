  Target Timeline: 2-3 weeksCurrent Version: 0.1.29Target Version: 0.2.0 (Production Ready)

  ---
  📋 Phase 1: Critical Reliability Fixes (3-4 days)

  Must complete before any production deployment

  1.1 Eliminate Panic Paths in Core Code

  Priority: 🔴 CRITICALFiles: src/python.rs, src/bindings.rs, src/pager/mod.rs

  Tasks:

  - [x] Replace mutex poisoning unwraps (80+ occurrences)
    - Files: src/python.rs:124+, src/bindings.rs:33+
    - ✅ Helper `acquire_lock` created in `src/error.rs` and applied across FFI layers
    - ✅ `.lock().unwrap()` usage replaced with safe locking + error propagation
    - ✅ Integration test `tests/lock_poison.rs` validates graceful degradation on panic
  - [x] Replace cache expect panic
    - File: src/pager/mod.rs:145
    - ✅ `.expect("page must exist")` replaced with corruption error handling
    - ✅ Added eviction regression test in `pager::tests::transaction_prevents_dirty_page_eviction`
  - [x] Replace NonZeroUsize unwraps
    - File: src/pager/mod.rs:80
    - ✅ Cache size now validated with proper error handling (`cache_size_zero_is_rejected` test)

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - ✅ cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes (verified via `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
  - ✅ Grep for unwrap() and expect() returns only test code
  - ✅ All 55 existing tests still pass (`cargo test`)

  Estimated Effort: 1 day

  1.2 Harden Deserialization Against Corruption

  Priority: 🔴 CRITICALFiles: src/pager/wal.rs, src/index/btree.rs, src/storage/record.rs, src/storage/ser.rs

  Tasks:

  - [x] Replace slice conversion expects in WAL reader
    - ✅ Added safe helpers in `src/pager/wal.rs` to parse frame headers with contextual corruption errors
  - [x] Harden BTree deserialization
    - ✅ Introduced header magic/versioning with exhaustive bounds checks in `src/index/btree.rs`
    - ✅ Added regression tests for unsupported versions and truncated buffers
  - [x] Add length validation to record deserialization
    - ✅ Defined `MAX_RECORD_SIZE` guardrails and non-panicking parsing in `src/storage/record.rs`
    - ✅ Propagated safe record encoding throughout node/edge insertion paths with new tests
  - [x] Create corruption fuzzing test
    - ✅ `tests/corruption_resistance.rs` performs 10,000 random DB/WAL corruptions and asserts graceful handling

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - ✅ All deserialization paths return `Result` instead of panicking
  - ✅ Fuzz test runs 10,000 iterations without panic (`tests/corruption_resistance.rs`)
  - ✅ Corrupted database returns `GraphError::Corruption` with context across WAL/BTree/record parsing

  Estimated Effort: 2 days

  ---
  1.3 Add Data Integrity Verification ✅ COMPLETED

  Priority: 🔴 CRITICALFiles: src/storage/page.rs, src/pager/mod.rs, src/storage/header.rs

  Tasks:

  - [x] Add page-level checksums
    - ✅ Reserve the final 4 bytes of each on-disk page image for a CRC32 checksum; keep `Pager::Page` as `Vec<u8>` and treat the trailing slice as checksum metadata
    - ✅ Compute and append checksum bytes whenever we flush or checkpoint pages (`Pager::flush_pages_internal`, `Pager::checkpoint`, shadow rollback paths)
    - ✅ Verify checksum during page loads (`Pager::fetch_page`, `Pager::read_page_from_disk`) and surface `GraphError::Corruption { page_id }` when the digest mismatches
    - ✅ Add a `Config::checksum_enabled` flag (default on, optional off for benchmarks/tests) and plumb it through pager creation and WAL replay
  - [x] Harden header version detection
    - ✅ Reuse existing `MAGIC` (`b"GRPHITE\0"`) and `VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR` constants in `src/storage/header.rs`
    - ✅ Define policy for bumping `VERSION_*` when checksum/storage layout changes and document migration expectations
    - ✅ Extend open-time validation to include targeted remediation guidance (e.g., "upgrade tool" vs. "downgrade unsupported")
  - [x] Add database integrity verification tooling
    - ✅ New method: `GraphDB::verify_integrity(config: IntegrityOptions) -> Result<IntegrityReport>`
    - ✅ Iterate pages via the pager without populating main caches (stream page ids, inspect `RecordPage`/`Header` views in-place)
    - ✅ Validate btree key ordering, record header lengths, node/edge existence, and adjacency references; aggregate counts + first N failures in `IntegrityReport`
    - ✅ Companion CLI: `src/bin/sombra-verify.rs` exposing options for checksum-only vs. full graph validation

  Acceptance Criteria:
  - ✅ Page corruption detected on read with specific error message (unit tests covering checksum mismatch + WAL replay)
  - ✅ Incompatible database version rejected on open
  - ✅ `verify_integrity()` catches common corruption patterns (targeted fixtures + corruption fuzz harness)
  - ✅ Performance impact < 3% with checksums enabled, measured by running the existing `benches/throughput.rs` workload with and without checksums (3 runs each, median compared)

  2. Durability: Data integrity verified through checksums and fuzzing
  3. Observability: Comprehensive logging and metrics for operations
  4. Documentation: Complete API docs and operational guides
  5. Testing: >80% coverage with stress, property, and fuzz tests
  6. Performance: Validated at scale with no regressions
  7. Operations: Deployment guides, monitoring, backup procedures
  8. Stability: Used in at least one production-like environment for 1 week
