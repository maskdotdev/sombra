# Monorepo Migration - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Configuration Files ✅
1. **`release-please-config.json`** - Configures release-please for three independent packages:
   - Rust core (`sombra`)
   - Node.js bindings (`sombradb`)
   - Python bindings (`sombra-py`)

2. **`.release-please-manifest.json`** - Tracks current versions (all at `0.3.3`)

3. **`COMPATIBILITY.md`** - Version compatibility matrix for users

4. **`README.md`** - Added version compatibility section with quick reference

### Phase 2: GitHub Workflows ✅

#### Release Management
- **`release-please.yml`** - Automated release PR creation based on conventional commits

#### Publishing Workflows
- **`publish-rust.yml`** - Publishes to crates.io on `sombra-v*` tags
- **`publish-npm.yml`** - Publishes to npm on `sombradb-v*` tags (multi-platform build)
- **`publish-python.yml`** - Publishes to PyPI on `sombra-py-v*` tags (multi-platform wheels)

#### Backup
- **`release-legacy.yml.bak`** - Backed up original release workflow

## How It Works

### Commit Format (Conventional Commits)
- `feat(core):` → Bumps Rust crate version
- `fix(js):` → Bumps Node.js package version
- `feat(py):` → Bumps Python package version
- `feat(core)!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version bump

### Release Flow
1. **Developer commits** using conventional format
2. **Release-please bot** opens PR with:
   - Version bump in appropriate `Cargo.toml`/`package.json`/`pyproject.toml`
   - Updated changelog
3. **Maintainer reviews** PR and updates `COMPATIBILITY.md`
4. **PR is merged** → Release-please creates:
   - GitHub Release
   - Git tag (e.g., `sombradb-v0.3.4`)
5. **Tag triggers** corresponding publish workflow
6. **Package published** to crates.io/npm/PyPI

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Setup
Before pushing to `main`, you can test locally:
```bash
# Check workflow syntax
gh workflow list

# View the changes
git diff README.md
git status
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
Add these secrets in GitHub repo settings:
- `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - From crates.io
- `NPM_TOKEN` - From npmjs.com  
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - From pypi.org

### 3. First Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(core): implement independent versioning for monorepo

BREAKING CHANGE: Migrated to independent versioning. Each language binding now releases independently based on conventional commits."
```

### 4. Test Release-Please
After merging to main:
1. Wait for release-please to scan commit history
2. It will open PRs for any detected changes
3. Review (but don't merge yet) to verify it works
4. Make a test commit like `feat(js): add test feature`
5. Verify release-please opens a new PR

### 5. Production Cutover
Once satisfied with testing:
```bash
# Delete the legacy workflow
rm .github/workflows/release-legacy.yml.bak
git commit -m "chore: remove legacy release workflow"
```

---

## Examples

### Python-only release
```bash
git commit -m "feat(py): add async query execution API"
# → PR: "chore: release sombra-py 0.3.4"
# → Tag: sombra-py-v0.3.4
# → Publishes only to PyPI
```

### Node.js bug fix
```bash
git commit -m "fix(js): correct TypeScript types for query methods"
# → PR: "chore: release sombradb 0.3.4"
# → Tag: sombradb-v0.3.4
# → Publishes only to npm
```

### Core breaking change
```bash
git commit -m "feat(core)!: redesign transaction API

BREAKING CHANGE: Transaction.commit() now returns Result. Update error handling in bindings."
# → PR: "chore: release sombra 0.4.0"
# → Tag: sombra-v0.4.0
# → Publishes only to crates.io
```

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Independent versioning** - Fix bugs in one binding without affecting others  
✅ **Automated changelogs** - Per-ecosystem changelog files  
✅ **Conventional commits** - Standardized commit messages  
✅ **GitHub Releases** - Tagged releases for each component  
✅ **Multi-platform builds** - Preserved existing NAPI and maturin workflows  
✅ **Backward compatible** - CI workflow (`ci.yml`) untouched

## File Structure

```
.github/workflows/
  ├── ci.yml                    (unchanged - still handles testing)
  ├── release-please.yml        (new - manages releases)
  ├── publish-rust.yml          (new - crates.io publishing)
  ├── publish-npm.yml           (new - npm publishing)
  ├── publish-python.yml        (new - PyPI publishing)
  └── release-legacy.yml.bak    (backup of old workflow)

release-please-config.json      (new - release-please config)
.release-please-manifest.json   (new - tracks versions)
COMPATIBILITY.md                (new - version matrix)
README.md                       (updated - version notice)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Release-please doesn't open PRs
- Check commit format follows conventional commits
- Verify bootstrap SHA is correct
- Check GitHub Actions logs

### Publishing fails
- Verify secrets are configured correctly
- Check tag format matches workflow conditions
- Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions

### Version conflicts
- Ensure `.release-please-manifest.json` matches actual versions
- If needed, manually update and commit
